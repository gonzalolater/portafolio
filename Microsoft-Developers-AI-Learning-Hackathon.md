## Microsoft Developers AI Learning Hackathon.

**Data is the foundation for AI**

AI is at the forefront of technological innovation, and we're here to guide you through the process of mastering it with Azure Cosmos DB and the Azure OpenAI API. At our hackathon, developers will gain invaluable insights into the database foundations that power revolutionary applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We're not just teaching you how to build your own AI copilot; we're empowering you to understand the data behind generative AI technologies.

Regardless of whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious newcomer, our hackathon welcomes participants of all backgrounds and skill levels. We'll be exploring our content using both Python and Node.js.

During this hackathon, you will also have support and the resources to learn how to select a database, how to integrate AI in a technical or non-technical solution, and how to build an AI copilot using vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB.

**Up to $10,000 in prizes are up for grabs** along with the opportunity for their project to be featured on Microsoft owned and operated social channels. Join us in the Microsoft Developers AI Learning Hackathon to embark on your journey towards AI proficiency and prepare for the era of AI.

**Let's get started building your AI app on Azure!**
* Access Azure OpenAI Service NOW
* Create a Microsoft Learn account
  * Please note: you must use the same Microsoft Learn account throughout the developer journey.

Register for the **two-part Azure Cosmos DB Developer Cloud Skills Challenge** to take part in Phase 1 of the hackathon!

* **Part 1 and Part 2 are both live!**

Concurrently, you'll need to follow one of the provided step-by-step developer guides to build your own custom AI copilot: 

 * Node.js version
 
 * Python version

**This challenge will offer learning modules for you to complete to win a Phase 1 prize.**

1️⃣ **What is Phase 1?**
Through a series of expertly crafted training modules, you'll learn how to build your own AI application powered by vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB and use the Azure OpenAI API.

Delving into features leveraged by ChatGPT, capabilities, best practices, and real-world use cases (such as vector database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)), you'll complete the challenge with a custom AI copilot. Armed with the skills and knowledge, you’ll be able to take on the application development in the era of AI.

**Once you have completed the Learning Journey and your AI application, you’ll be able to move on to Phase 2 of the hackathon!**

2️⃣ **What is Phase 2?**
Phase 2 is where you’ll refine and integrate your custom AI copilot into a new or existing project on Azure. Using the new skills gained, you’ll compete for a Learn and Integrate Award, showcasing your creativity and expertise while exploring AI and cloud technologies.

You won’t want to miss it! Head over to the Learning Journey tab to get started.
